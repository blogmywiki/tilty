A simple game for BBC MicroBit written in Python

I am lucky enough to have 3 teacher BBC MicroBits to play with, and I am exploring using the awesome Mu Python editor – this allows you easily to program the MicroBit in Python totally offline, with absolutely no internet access at all. This means you can still play with your MicroBit come the zombie apocalypse, assuming we still have electricity. (I’ve seen bits of Zombieland, so I know the electricity stays on in these situations.)

Here’s my first attempt at writing a game. It’s really simple but has TWENTY levels (sort of). You tilt your MicroBit to colour in all the pixels. When you fill in all 25, you move on to the next level… but the game gets harder to control as the delay in the loop gets shorter. It’s pretty easy but quite maddening if you get one pixel that you can’t fill in.

Hook up a speaker to pins 0 and GND if you want to hear the sounds.

You could improve the game in lots of ways, for example by having random events to wipe out certain pixels so you have to fill them in again, or by having obstacles you must NOT touch. Tinker, enjoy!
